The maketrans() function is a function from the library str that is used to construct a transition table, i.e that it specifies a list of characters that need to be replaced in a string or the characters that need to be deleted from the string. To use this transition table, you can use the translate() function and apply that on a string. It is also possible to use these functions to remove the punctuations. Similar to the example below, apply the maketrans() function to remove punctuations from the nld_eng array.**"
