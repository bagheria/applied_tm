The Silhouette Coefficient for a sample is (b - a) / max(a,b). To clarify, b is the distance between a sample and the nearest cluster that the sample is not a part of. The best value is 1 and the worst value is -1. Values near 0 indicate overlapping clusters. Negative values generally indicate that a sample has been assigned to the wrong cluster, as a different cluster is more similar."

Just like clustering algorithms, there are some algorithms that need you to specify the number of topics you want to extract from the data set and some that automatically determine the number of topics.
